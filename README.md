# Greedy

##problems based on greedy algorithms.

#### 1) You are going to travel to another city that is located d miles away from your home city. Your car can travel at most m miles on a full tank and you start with a full tank. Along your way, there are gas stations at distances stop1 , stop2 , . . . , stopn from your home city. What is the minimum number of refills needed?

#### 2) Given a set of n segments {[a0, b0], [a1, b1 ], . . . , [an−1, bn−1 ]} with integer coordinates on a line, find the minimum number m of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a set of integers X of the minimum size such that for any segment [ai , bi ] there is a point x ∈ X such that ai ≤ x ≤ bi .

#### 3) The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.

#### 4) Compose the largest number out of a set of integers.

#### 5) Task. The goal of this problem is to represent a given positive integer n as a sum of as many pairwise distinct positive integers as possible. That is, to find the maximum k such that n can be written as a1 + a2 + · · · + ak where a1 , . . . , ak are positive integers and ai ̸= aj for all 1 ≤ i < j ≤ k.
